# linear-equation-generator

This is an overcomplicated python script that generates a linear equation in slope-intercept from when given two ordered pairs.

It doesn't do anything else, I wrote this because I was tired of wasting paper when using point-slope forn to find bounds and paths of integration

It spits an answer out in float, meaning it doesn't give you an exact answer. I plan on updating this so that, when prompted, a user can generate slope 
in either float or an exact rational number. Or I might not put much more thought into this, seeing as I didn't even use Numpy for this 'project'.
